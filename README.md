# Sypherize

**Sypherize** (with an *S*) is a compiler written in C, for a C like language
called **Sypher**.

## Overwiew

I will be developing this project by following
[`Lens_r's`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLysa8wRFCssxGKj_RxBWr3rwmjEYlJIpa)
playslist on youtube which outlines the complete process
of desigining and implementing a compiler.

The file [`RoadMap.md`](https://github.com/Ruturajn/Sypherize/blob/main/RoadMap.md)
is a summary of what I picked up from the playslist, which include a set of
steps, that outline the whole design.
