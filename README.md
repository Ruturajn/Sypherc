# CLomp

**CLomp** is a compiler written in C, for a C like language.

I will be developing this project by following the
[`Lens_r's`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLysa8wRFCssxGKj_RxBWr3rwmjEYlJIpa)
playslist on youtube which outlines the complete process
of desigining and implementing a compiler.

The file [`RoadMap.md`](https://github.com/Ruturajn/CComp/blob/main/RoadMap.md)
is a summary of what I picked up from the playslist, which include a set of
steps, that outline the whole design.
